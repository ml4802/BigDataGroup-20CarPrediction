# Summary 
Our project aims to use online used-car listing data to help customers decide the best
time to sell or buy their vehicle. To this objective, we created a web application
that, once given some information about a car, will predict the fairest price for the 
car based on previous listings, predict similar car prices for bracketing model years,
scrape existing listings and their links/pricing, and more. 

## How to run web demo:
    Run app.py inside web_app, and navigate to http://127.0.0.1:5000
    to view the webpage
    Must run on tensorflow-enabled computer

## How to process raw Kaggle data:
    See data_processing.R for instructions on how to transform Craigslist
    Kaggle dataset into data_with_income.csv, and one_hotted_training_data.csv
    Dataset used to train models and generate R is at
    https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/austinreese/craigslist-carstrucks-data
    called Vehicles.csv
